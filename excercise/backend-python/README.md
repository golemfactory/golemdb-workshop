#### Running the Backend (Python)

1. If you donâ€™t have the **Poetry** package manager installed, visit [python-poetry.org](https://python-poetry.org/) for installation instructions.

2. Navigate to the `excercise/backend-python` directory in the workshop repo.

3. Start the FastAPI development server:

   ```bash
   poetry run fastapi dev main.py
   ```

The backend server should now be running at **http://localhost:8000**.
